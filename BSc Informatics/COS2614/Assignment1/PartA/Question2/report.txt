not going to lie this took me so much longer than it needed to
not sure if it was due to being very tired on not completely having my head around pointers (understand it way better now)
got stuck for a solid 50 minutes ,but all i had to do was change the object the pointer was pointing at instead of trying
to make the pointer = to another pointer
